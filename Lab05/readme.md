##  Background Theory
3.1 Image Classification

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision where an input image is assigned a label or category from a predefined set of classes. It involves extracting meaningful features from an image and using these features to predict the most probable class.

Traditional image classification relied on manually designed features such as edges, corners, and textures. However, modern systems use deep learning models that automatically learn hierarchical features from raw pixel data.

3.2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

A Convolutional Neural Network is a specialized type of deep neural network designed for processing grid-like data such as images. CNNs consist of multiple layers that progressively extract higher-level features.
